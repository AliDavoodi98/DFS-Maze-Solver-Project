# DFS Maze Solver Project

## Description

This DFS (Depth-First Search) Maze Solver Project is designed to help visualize the process of depth-first search in exploring paths within a given matrix. It highlights the current cell being visited and updates the matrix's state at each step, providing insights into how the DFS algorithm explores all possible paths from each starting cell.

## Features

- Visualization of the DFS exploration process in real-time.
- Calculation and display of the maximum path length found by the DFS.
- Ability to input custom matrices via command-line arguments for flexible testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- `matplotlib` library installed for Python. This can be installed using `pip`:

```sh
pip install matplotlib
